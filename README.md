## static-mvc-spa-boilerplate

A static Model-View-Controller Single-Page-Application boilerplate that provide modular proramming in client-side with CoffeeScript

I wrote and used this boilerplate in my school's assignment

## dependencies

You need a web server (nginx/apache) for serving the static resources (.html, .js, .css)

## development

For development, you need CoffeeScript to write coffee, and compiles into JS

Run ```watch-compile.sh``` to watch & recompile your coffees when you're coding
